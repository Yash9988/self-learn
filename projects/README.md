<center><img src="../assets/images/projects/django.jpg" alt="django-banner" height="250"/></center>
Django Web Applications showcase a collection of web applications built with the Django framework.

* [First Project](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/django/firstproject/)
    * Implemented and documented the development process for a simple django web application.
    * Used Django's built-in admin panel for managing the application's data.

* [Littlelemon Project](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/django/littlelemon/)
    * Leveraging the learnings from the first project, developed a more complex web application for a restaurant website called Little Lemon.
    * Integrated Django's authentication system for user management.
    * Used Django REST framework for building APIs.
