# Projects

## [Deepseek-V3](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/deepseek-v3/transformer.ipynb)
* Implemented the Deepseek-V3 transformer model architecture from scratch using PyTorch.
* The model is designed to perform image classification tasks efficiently.


## [GPT-2](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/gpt2/transformer.ipynb)
* Implemented the GPT-2 model architecture for text generation tasks from scratch.
* Trained the model on the "tiny-shakespeare" dataset, and then later on huggingface's [fineweb-edu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu) dataset, achieving impressive results.

    * A beginner-level dashboard showcasing basic data analysis techniques.


## [PySpark](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/pyspark/spark-tutorial.ipynb)
A beginner-level course on PySpark, covering the basics concepsts of data processing and analysis using Spark.


## [Django Web Applications](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/django/)
Django Web Applications showcase a collection of web applications built with the Django framework.

* ### [First Project](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/django/firstproject/)
    * Implemented and documented the development process for a simple django web application.
    * Used Django's built-in admin panel for managing the application's data.

* ### [Littlelemon Project](https://github.com/Yash9988/self-learn/tree/main/projects/django/littlelemon/)
    * Leveraging the learnings from the first project, developed a more complex web application for a restaurant website called Little Lemon.
    * Integrated Django's authentication system for user management.
    * Used Django REST framework for building APIs.
