# Algorithm Implementations

## [Heap](heap.py)
Implementation of Min-Heap data structure using a dictionary.

## [Heap Sort](heapSort.py)
Implementation of Heap sort algorithm using the Min-Heap data structure from above.

## [Merge Sort](mergeSort.py)
Implementation of Merge sort algorithm using the divide and conquer approach.

## [Quick Sort](quickSort.py)
Implementation of Quick sort algorithm using the divide and conquer approach.

## [Prime Number Sieve](primes.py)
Implementation of various Sieve algorithms to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

## [Slope Algorithm](diff.py)
* Implementation of the Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation (Slope Algorithm) using a custom `Dual` class to handle complex numbers with dual parts (real and dual epsilon).
* This algorithm is useful for computing derivatives in computational graphs efficiently.
